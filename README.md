# PageReplacementSim
**Description:** <br/>
This is a terminal program written in C++ made to simulate three page replacement algorithms; first in first out, random, and least recently used replacement.
when executing the program as it goes through the three algorithms the program also collects the data of the the number of page faults and page replacements
aswell as the time taken to execute a given algorithm. <br/><br/>
*Note: This program does not simulate the secondary memory along with the virtual memory, only the primary memory* <br/>
